MATH LAUNCH

This program is a game written in 1985 by my long time
friend, mr. John Pospisil of Sydney, Australia.

I got the listing on paper in 2012, then I decided
that it was time to publish it.

I ended typing it on my PC and fixed a few minor errors
in it.

USAGE

The game was originally programmed as a "multi-load" game,
with part one containing the instructions and the loader
to the second part - which is the actual game.

I joined the two parts and made the program into a single
one.

The multiload version is still included.
