CREATI-BLITZ!

This is a beta-version of a simple videogame, which I
programmed back in 2001 and never finished due to the
lack of time/will.

INSTRUCTIONS
Your airplane is slowly falling down on an hostile
city, and your aim is to bomb all skycrapers in order
to clear the ground and then land safely.
