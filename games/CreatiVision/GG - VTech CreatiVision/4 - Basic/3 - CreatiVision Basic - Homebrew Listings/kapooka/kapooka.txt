Kapooka
A game for CreatiVision BASIC
Programmed by Paul Rahme, 2009-10.
In memory of Bert Van Zyl, level designer for Kapooka.

Kapooka is a logic game, where you play the role of the red blob. The object
of each level is to push the green blobs out of the way, to try reach the exit
(E).

Control the character using the left hand joystick. Pressing the FIRE button
will restart the current level.

The game was originally written for linux (http://kapooka.sourceforge.net),
but the linux version no longer works.

Hope you enjoy the game!

Thanks to Luca Antignano for developing FunnyMu (with the ability to load .TXT
files), and for pointing me to the books & articles containing tricks used to
avoid the BASIC memory limits!

K = current level number
L = current level
N = next level line number
O = x offset of board's top left corner
P = y offset of board's top left corner
W = current board width
Z = player pos

Blocks:
0 = empty space
1 = static block
2 = wall
