ODDEVEN

Oddeven is a game of logic, similar to "Mastermind" or "Bulls and Cows".

You have to determine the 3 digit number that the Computer has chosen.

All numbers from 0 and 999 can be used.

The left joystick is used to play.

Your guesses are entered one digit at a time.
To make your choice, move the joystick left or right to move the pointer.

The fire button enters the digit, moving the joystick down erases the previous digit.
Moving the joystick up enters the guess.

You will be told how many digits are correct in both value and position by the colour
of the guess. The number is entered in green.

Green (even) 0 or 2 (no change)

Red   (odd)  1 or 3 (colour changes)

NOTE: a correct digit in the wrong position is ignored.

A tone will sound when the guess is registered: odd and even have different tones.

A 'guess' will only give 'odd' or 'even'. You must 'test' your choice to see
if you are right!  You get 20 guesses, but only 3 tests.

Good luck!

The game defaults to 3 digit numbers, but can be altered to use 4 or 5 digits,
the number of guesses will be adjusted appropriately.
