CV PAINT 2001

This is an easy to use painting tool. My very first attempt
to programming on the CreatiVision Basic. Canvas is 17x15
dots only due to limitations to the Basic "DIM" statements.

INSTRUCTIONS
Use left joystick to move your brush around the canvas,
then push any joystick button to draw a dot.
You can change brush color by hitting keys 'A' to 'O'
and also fill canvas with current brush color by hitting
'Z'.
Press 'RETURN' to quit program
