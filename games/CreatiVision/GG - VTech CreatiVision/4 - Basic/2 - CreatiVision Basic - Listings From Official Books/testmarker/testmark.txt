TEST MARKER

This program is a good example of how Wizzard can be programmed
to do tedious and repetitive tasks extremely accurately and
incredibly fast! This particular program will mark and give
results for up to 50 students.  You simply enter the number of
questions you require, the correct answers (numerical only) and
the students results. When the last student's results have been
entered, Wizzard will summarize the whole group's results
including percentages and averages.
