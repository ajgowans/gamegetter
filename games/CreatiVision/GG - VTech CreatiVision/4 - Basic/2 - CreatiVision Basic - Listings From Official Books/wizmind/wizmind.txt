WIZZARD MIND

This game is a computerised version of one of the world's most
popular games, Mastermind. You are pitted against the amazing
Wizzard...Can you win?

The game is played using the same rules as for Mastermind. You
have to choose from six colours by using the Left Hand Joystick
to 'rotate' the selector to the required colour, pressing the
Right Hand Joystick will 'select' the currently blinking colour
and enter it to the 'board'. Note that you cannot use the same
colour twice.

For each colour correctly selected, you will be given a white
marker while for each colour correctly selected AND placed in
the right position, you will be given a black marker. From
these 'clues' you will have to try to deduce the correct colour
combination. Remember that you only have ten turns to do it in.
If unsuccessful, the correct combination will be displayed at
the top of the 'board' for you.  Good luck!
