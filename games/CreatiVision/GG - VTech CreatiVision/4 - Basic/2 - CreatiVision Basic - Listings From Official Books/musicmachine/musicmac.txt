WIZZARD MUSIC MACHINE

With this highly innovative program, Wizzard makes it easy for
you to write and perform your own tunes. Having written your
tune, you can listen to it and see it displayed, re-write
sections of it, add to the end of the tune, change individual
notes and add the name of the composer. An added feature is the
ability of the program to print out the tune on paper for future
reference. While we won't guarantee to turn you into a Mozart,
it will provide lots of fun!

For details on correct note usage, we suggest that you consult
your BASIC Reference manual.
