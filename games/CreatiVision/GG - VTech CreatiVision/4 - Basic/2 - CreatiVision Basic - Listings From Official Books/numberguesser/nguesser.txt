WIZZARD NUMBER GUESSER

In this program, Wizzard thinks of a number and your job is to
guess that number. When you have entered your guess, Wizzard
will inform you as to whether your guess is 'TOO LOW' or 'TOO
HIGH'. You also will be given the opportunity to set the upper
limit for the number to be guessed. How many tries will it take
you to 'get it right'?
