WIZZARD SKETCH

Here is a program that allows you to use the joysticks to
sketch simple drawings to your T.V. screen. To draw once the
program is entered, simply 'move' the Left Hand Joystick
controller in any of its 8 main positions to create a drawing
of your choosing. The Right Hand Joystick is used to erase
those areas of the drawing that you wish removed.
