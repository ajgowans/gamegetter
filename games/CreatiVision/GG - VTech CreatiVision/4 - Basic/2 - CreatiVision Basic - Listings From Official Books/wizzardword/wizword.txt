WIZZARD WORD

In this program you need a friend (don't we all!) to give
Wizzard a word. He will then cleverly jumble up the word in
different ways until you get it right! Make sure the word is
not too long as it can become next to impossible to sort out.
This game will provide lots of fun and quite possibly a fair
dose of frustration!
