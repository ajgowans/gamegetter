WIZZARD HANGMAN

As the first program in our book, we thought it would be
appropriate to give you the opportunity to 'hang' yourself.
Accordingly, we present the Wizzard version of the traditional
'Hangman' game. in our version, your 'opponent' chooses a word
of up to 13 characters in length which he enters into the
computer. It is then up to you to successfully guess the correct
letter combination and hence the 'word' without allowing
yourself to be hung. A unique feature of this game is the use of
the joystick to select the required character. This game
includes both graphics and music.
