# The MiSTer Game Getter Database For Obscure Systems

This is a database for the MiSTer project that downloads games, and software, for obscure older systems.

Included systems will download any software to a folder prexied with "GG - "  within the relevant games folder e.g. "GG - Bandai RX-78".  This avoids any downloads mixing in games with ones currently in the main games folder for the specific core.

To use it simply copy and paste the below to the bottom of your downloader.ini file (found at: /media/fat/downloader.ini )

```ini
[ajgowans/gamegetter]
db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgowans/gamegetter/db/db.json.zip
